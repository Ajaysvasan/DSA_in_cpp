# C++ Learning Repository

Welcome to my C++ Learning Repository! 🚀 Here, I document my journey of mastering C++ by solving problems, building projects, and exploring advanced concepts.

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository serves as a collection of my C++ code, including:
- **Fundamental Concepts**: Basics like variables, loops, functions, OOP, STL, and more.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Implementations of sorting, searching, linked lists, trees, graphs, and other DSA topics.
- **Competitive Programming**: Solutions to problems from LeetCode, Codeforces, and other platforms.
- **Real-World Projects**: Practical applications like a Music Recommendation System, Git Clone, HFT-based project, and a Mini OS with AI integration.

## 📚 Learning Roadmap
I am following a structured learning path, which includes:
1. **Mastering C++ Fundamentals** ✅
2. **Exploring STL (Standard Template Library)** ✅
3. **Solving DSA Problems** 🚀
4. **Building Real-World Projects** 💻
5. **Optimizing Code for Performance** ⚡

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++ (Modern C++17/20)
- STL (Standard Template Library)
- Algorithms & Data Structures
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Memory Management & Optimization

## 🚀 How to Use
To run any of the code files, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++` for GCC or `cl` for MSVC).

```bash
# Compile a C++ file
 g++ filename.cpp -o output

# Run the executable
 ./output
```
